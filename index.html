          <p>It all originated from modern quantum theory which was developed in the 1920s, used to explain wave-particle duality observed at atomic scales. Thus leading to the creation of digital computers which paved the way to the removal of human computers due to human computers being incapable of doing tedious calculations for long periods of time.</p>

          <p>Physicists swapped out bits for qubits in quantum computing, thus quantum mechanics and computer science started to converge. In 1980, physicist Paul Benioff introduced the Quantum Turing Machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simple computer. Quantum algorithms emerged afterwards to solve oracle problems. Peter Shor used results from solved oracle problems, and built on them with "Shor's algorithm" to solve widely known and used encryption protocols, thus drawing a lot of attention to quantum computing.</p>

          <p>In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that any classical machine cannot replicate. However, the validity of this claim is still being researched.</p>

          <p>In December 2023, scientists from Harvard University successfully created "quantum circuits" that correct errors more efficiently than alternative methods, which may remove a major obstacle to practical quantum computers.</p>

          <p>Quantum algorithms can be roughly catogorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms. There doesn't exist any mathematical proof that a classical algorithm can't match the computing speed of a quantum algorithm but evidence shows that it is unlikely to happen.</p>

          <p>Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding prime factors in an integer. It is one of the few known quantum algorithms with compelling potential applications and strong evidence of superpolynomial speedup compared to best known classical algorithms.</p>

          <p>The concerns for Shor's algorithm include that factoring numbers of practical significance require more qubits than available in the future. Another concern is that noise in quantum circuits may undermine results.</p>

          <p>Shor proposed multiple similar algorithms for solving the factoring problem, discrete logarithm problem and the period-finding problem. 'Shor's algorithm' usually refers to the factoring problem, but it can actually be referring of the 3 mentioned. The discrete logarithm and factoring problem are instances of the period-finding problem. While all 3 of them are instances of the hidden subgroup problem.</p>

          <p>Hidden subgroup problem(HSP) is a framework that captures problems such as the factoring, discrete logarithm, graph isomorphism, and the shortest vector problem. That makes it essential in the theory of quantum computing.</p>

          <p>Bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, while as a qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. A bit, by definition exists in two physical states. Which can be denoted to 0 and 1. A qubit is also described a state, often written as |0> and |1>. Those two serve as the quantum counterparts of the of the classical states of 0 and 1.</p>

          <p>The quantum states |0> and |1> belong to a vector space. This means that they can be multiplied by constants and added together. Such a combination is known as a superposition of |0> and |1>. A 2-dimensional vector mathematically represents a qubit state. Physicists typically use Dirac's notation for linear algebra, writing |Ψ>. 'ket psi', for a vector labeled Ψ.</p>

          <p>A qubit is a 2-state system. Any qubit takes the form α|0> + ß|1> as its standard basis states. While α and ß are the probability amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers. If either α or ß is a zero, the qubit is essentially a classical bit. But when both are non-zero, the qubit is in superposition.</p>
